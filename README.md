### :warning: Warning regarding Meteor 1.3 :warning:

   Meteor recently updated to 1.3, and while we don't expect any issues we advise you don't update your installation yet. You will get prompted to run `meteor update` once the update has downloaded in the background. Please refrain from running it, until we can confirm everything will continue to work.

   * **Custom Notifications**
      * Users can customize both the Notifications Title as well as the Notifications body. You can access this from the "Notifications" section of the admin panel.
      * We've added the ability to create dynamic custom notifications through the use of tags; The available tags are listed and described below:
         * **\<type\>**   - Type of request that was made, either a "Movie" or "TV"
         * **\<user\>**   - The user that placed the request
         * **\<issues\>** - The issues associated with the request
         * **\<year\>**   - Year the requested content was released. For TV shows, this is the year the first episode aired.
         * **\<link\>**   - The link to the requested medias TVDB/TVMaze information page.

      * These tags can be used anywhere in the Notifications body and title. The default settings are an example how to utilize the tags in your messages.

## Installation
   * Installation is straightforward: please update to Meteor 1.2.1, clone the repo, `cd` into the directory, and run `meteor`. For Windows users check out this **[blog post](http://8bits.ca/posts/2015/installing-plex-requests-on-windows/)** for installation instructions using Git!

   * On first run navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin` and create an admin account with an email address and password. **If this isn't done someone else can create the admin account to your application.** This account is only used for logging in, email integration isn't enabled.
